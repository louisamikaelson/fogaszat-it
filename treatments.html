                How do Bridges Work?
            </br> </br>
            A bridge may be recommended if you're missing one or more teeth. Gaps left by missing teeth eventually cause the 
            remaining teeth to rotate or shift into the empty spaces, resulting in a bad bite. The imbalance caused by missing 
            teeth can also lead to gum disease and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.

            <p class="hosszu-p-text">
                Bridges are commonly used to replace one or more missing teeth. They span the space where the teeth are missing. 
                Bridges are cemented to the natural teeth or implants surrounding the empty space. These teeth, called abutments, 
                serve as anchors for the bridge. A replacement tooth, called a pontic, is attached to the crowns that cover the 
                abutments.

                As with crowns, you have a choice of materials for bridges. Your dentist can help you decide which to use, based 
                on the location of the missing tooth (or teeth), its function, aesthetic considerations and cost. Porcelain or 
                ceramic bridges can be matched to the color of your natural teeth.

                    Recently in dentistry, satisfying aesthetic requirements have become more and more important. An almost new, 
                    mixed kind of dental special field emerged, which beyond the dental defining and knowing of nice as a notion, 
                    considers its realisation an important guideline: here we list some of its tools. Applying metals for filling 
                    and substitution should be avoided. A certain type of plastic that is based on modern technology was 
                    transferred from space research to civil usage. Inorganic (glass, quartz, porcelain, silicon dioxide, etc.) 
                    granules are mixed into synthetic resin, thus a quite massive, resistant and transparent material is created. 
                    Several aesthetic filling are made of composite.

            <p class="hosszu-p-text">
            A special kind of veneer, the porcelain veneer-technique means a glued, 0,7 thick ceramic sheet. It can be applied in 
            case of filled tooth if the filling is not too big, but we apply mainly on the external surface of the frontal teeth. 
            Its advantage is that less teeth must be ground (05-1 mm). We use it to correct the shape, position and colour of 
            teeth and to reach the best aesthetic effect.
            </br> </br>
            This solution can be applied, when there are defections deriving from developmental abnormality, discolours, or other 
            deformities on the frontal teeth. In case of removing a small quantity of tooth-structure, we glue a very thin, veneer-like, 
            individual ceramic-layer, which is made after an impression, on the external surface of the teeth (mainly on the upper 
            frontal teeth), which makes teeth much more aesthetic.

                pulpitic pain appears, usually at night, because of the tension of the gases derives from the inflammation of 
                veins and nerves in it. Without a doubt, all of us have various experiences related to root treatment, based on 
                either personal or our acquaintances' stories. 
            </br> </br>
            Considering that instead of removing and replacing a tooth, we can keep our own teeth with this kind of intervention, 
            it is reasonable to choose root treatment. Root treatment causes less unpleasantness than tooth substitution.
            </br> </br>
            During root treatment, after thorough anaesthetisation the dentist removes the inflamed tooth-nerves and veins, 
            and pain also considerably decreases. After that on some occasion dentine is treated with antiseptic and medicines, 
            and when the tooth becomes symptom free, root-filling can be done. The latter can be executed without anaesthetic. 
            After successful root-filling the tooth must be cover-filled, usually it is worth protecting it with a crown.

            cyst in the jawbone or serious inflammation, because scraps stuck in the pocket between the tooth and the gum may 
            cause bacterial inflammation. Besides this, such pockets spoils oral hygiene and can be a reason for bad breath.

                Such intervention is necessary when for example there is a chronic inflammation around the root-tip, or such pulp, 
                which can not be treated with root-filling for some reasons, or if the root-tip of the tooth reaches into the 
                cyst-cavity of the jawbone and the doctor decides to keep the tooth. After the intervention the treated area 
                slightly swells up, it is useful to have a rest for a day or two. Some analgesic or cold compress may also be needed.

                If we don't clean our teeth often enough, plaque and calculus starts to accumulate on our teeth. This can cause
                gum infections and bad breath. Calculus on our theeth can only be removed by a dentist or a dental hygienist.
            </br> </br>
                In our dental clinic, we use a modern ultrasonic instrument with which we can effectively remove all debris from the teeth.
                It makes the procedure faster and pain-free.

            After ensuring the proper gum protection, the dental hygenist puts the tooth whitening paste on our teeth, which will be lit
            by a special-wavelength blue light to whiten our teeth.</br>
            Our dental hygenists have a lot of routine with tooth whitening. It is a risk-free, pain-free procedure, which usually
            takes about 120 minutes.
